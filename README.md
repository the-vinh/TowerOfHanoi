# TowerOfHanoi
first ever project
...in Matlab :v

The first version, TowerOfHanoi, is quite bad. I have to use up to six functions which call each other and recursively. This is to overcome the issue with displaying status of the piles after each move. But after thinking a little bit more, I realise another solution, without having to break up the nicely unique recursion.

Anyway, first complete project!
